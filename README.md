# Tricks

The list of little refactorings.

## What is refactoring?

Refactoring here is the small set of changes to a small amount code that highly improves readability, and/or perfomance.

## How to format a refactoring?

Provide source link for your code, paste it right below the link, and describe each of the changes step-by-step.

Here is the [example](./scala.md#use-for-comprehension).

## How to navigate?

The refactorings are stored in the file of their language. Check the list of available languages:

- [Rust](./rust.md)
- [Scala](./scala.md)

## What languages it is targetted for?

All of them! If there is no refactorings of your language, don't be shy to PR it first.

# Tricks

The list of small context-free refactorings.

## What is context-free refactoring?

- "Context-free" means that you can derive all the types for refactoring straight from the given code sample.
- "Refactoring" is a small set of changes to a code that highly improves readability, and/or perfomance.

## How to format a refactoring?

Provide source link for your code, paste it right below the link, and describe each of the changes step-by-step.

Here is the [example](./scala.md#use-for-comprehension).

## How to navigate?

The refactorings are stored in the file of their language. Check the list of available languages:

- [Elixir](./elixir.md)
- [Rust](./rust.md)
- [Scala](./scala.md)

## What languages it is targetted for?

All of them! If there is no refactorings of your language, don't be shy to PR!
